This fully resets your Windows network, without the need for a restart.

Run 'reset.bat' whenever your download stops or becomes very slow.

Run 'reset_silent.bat' if you don't want to be bothered by a Y/N option or if you are automating.

You do not need to restart your computer, router or modem. Just run the .BAT, and you're done.

If your internet connection stops working after running it, please run "undo.bat".
